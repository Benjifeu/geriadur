## An application about the celtic languages
The application Gerdarzh is a dictionary and mini-game around the theme of celtic languages (Gaulish, Irish, Breton and Welsh essentially). The project is currently under construction and is not fully runnable for now.

Gerdarzh constists of a consultative part with a lexic of celtic words with french and english translations, as well as their type, genre, phonetic form, and eventually the etymological link with other celtic words.

The other part is a mini-game which consists of guessing the literal meaning of a Celtic word or of Celtic origin, generally proper nouns. A lot

## Why?
The purpose of this project is to share and understand deeper the original sense of the celtic words used today in the celtic languages. A lot 



## Techniques
The application is web oriented with an  html/javascript/CSS interface layer, a java layer for the data treatment, and a mySql database who persist the data. 

The java layer is essentially build with the framework Spring and use the Java Persistence API (JPA) to organise relational data.
